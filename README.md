## Face-Music 
A smart web app that is also an organic music instrument :) 

It works be detecting your facial expressions aka features from your camera and as the expressions change, various sounds are played, thereby giving the control of music making to the face of the user.

The app is created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org) for graphics, [ml5.js](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/face-api) for face detection and [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) for music making.

### Steps to run:

- Download/Clone this project
- start local server on your machine
- point the local server to load index.html file on your browser
- Allow the browser to detect teh face using camera/webcam
- Play with your facial expression and make music! (music is coming soon!)
